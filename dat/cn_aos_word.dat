	Soma Cruz	Mina Hakuba	Genya Arikado	Graham Jones	Yoko Belnades	J	???	Julius Belmont	Hammer	???	The year is 2035. \n
Japan.\n
Crowds of spectators are \n
gathering around in anticipation of \n
the first full solar eclipse of the \n
twenty-first century.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
My name is Soma Cruz, and I am\n
a high school exchange student\n
studying abroad in Japan.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I live near the Hakuba Shrine,\n
an ancient shrine with strong\n
ties to Japanese mythology.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Mina Hakuba, the only daughter of \n
the shrine's caretaker, is both \n
my classmate and my childhood friend.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I started making my way to the \n
shrine to see the solar eclipse \n
with Mina. But, for some strange \n
reason, the stairway leading up to \n
the shrine felt longer than usual, \n
as if something was trying to keep \n
us from our destination.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When I finally managed to get \n
through the shrine gate, and my senses\n
began to dim...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
The pitch black sun is holding\n
chaotic darkness together,\n
trying to rouse a sleeping soul as if\n
looking for its missing other half...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oh...Mmm......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Hey, looks like he's\n
coming to.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Where am I...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
WHOA!\n
What... happened?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x07}
So you've decided to \n
join us... Did you have\n
a pleasant nap?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Huh?\n
Who the heck are you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
It's OK, Soma.\n
His name is Genya \n
Arikado...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Skip the introductions.\n
I have a few questions, \n
and I need answers now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Go... go ahead...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Why have you come here?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Why? Well, Mina and I...\n
Hang on, where are we?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
We're in Dracula's Castle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Huh? Dracula's Castle?\n
Are you telling me we are\n
in Europe?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
No. We are inside\n
the solar eclipse.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Inside the eclipse?!\n
You're insane!\n
Do you think I'm a fool?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma!\n
Listen to him, he's\n
telling you the truth!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What the heck are you \n
talking about? Give\n
me an explanation!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Well, it's like this...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Huh?!\n
An enemy!\n
{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Damn!\n
Protect the girl!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yaaaaaaaah!\n
Go back to where you came \n
from!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wha... what was that thing?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
So it has awakened.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What?  What has?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
The spirit of the \n
creature you killed has\n
just entered your body. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You have the power to \n
absorb the abilities of \n
the monsters you kill.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wh... why... why\n
would I have that  \n
power...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
You have gained the power. \n
Now you must go to the\n
Master's chamber.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
For what reason?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Do you not wish to return\n
with your friend to your \n
own world?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Of course I want to go back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Go to the Master's \n
chamber. Then, you will \n
understand everything.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
But I can't just leave\n
Mina here like this.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
No need to worry about\n
her. I'll put up a\n
protective barrier. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But death will most \n
certainly find those who\n
stay here too long.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
The... then I...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Yes. Only you\n
can save her from\n
a painful death.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
And you, what will you \n
do?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
I, too, have things I\n
must do within\n
these castle walls.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{NEXTACTION}
Go. Set forth! Both your \n
own life and hers are\n
at stake.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Go. Set forth! Both your \n
own life and hers are\n
at stake.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x07}
Oh?\n
Hello there.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Uh, h-hello.\n
Y-You're human, aren't you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Relax. My name is Graham.\n
Let's just say... I'm a\n
missionary. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oh... I'm... Soma,\n
Soma Cruz.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
You weren't here in this \n
shrine before, were you? \n
How did you get here?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I'm not sure. I went\n
through the shrine gate... \n
and BOOM I was here.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
I see...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Uh, can I ask you\n
a question?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Go ahead,\n
I don't mind.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Is it true that this\n
is Dracula's castle?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
It most certainly is.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
But, isn't Dracula's\n
castle in Europe\n
somewhere?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
In theory, yes. But his \n
TRUE castle exists\n
somewhere else.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
His true castle?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Yes.  It's a well known \n
fact in the underworld. Do\n
you believe in vampires?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Well, uh, no.  I thought\n
the story of Dracula was\n
made up, actually.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
No, it's all true.\n
It was leaked to the\n
outside world.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Usually, the church\n
handles these things with \n
utmost secrecy...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Over the course of time, \n
Dracula has resurrected\n
many times...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
when people lost\n
faith... and craved\n
chaos and destruction...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
So... are you trying to tell \n
me now that Dracula has \n
been resurrected?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
No. \n
Dracula perished in \n
1999.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You know of the \n
prophecy of 1999,\n
don't you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Nostradamus' great\n
prophecy...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
That's right.\n
Dracula was resurrected \n
exactly as he predicted.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But, vampire hunters\n
destroyed him\n
completely.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
They ended his\n
regeneration cycle by\n
sealing his castle...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
the symbol of his demonic \n
power, inside the \n
darkness of an eclipse.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
And that eclipse\n
 is where we are now...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Yes, but there's still\n
more to the story...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
There's more?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
"In the year 2035, a new \n
master will come to the  \n
castle, and he...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
will inherit ALL of \n
Dracula's powers."\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
But that's...!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Yes. That time is now!\n
I better get going..\n
Is that all, then?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oh, yes. Thank you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Farewell and\n
be careful.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yes, you too.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x07}
Hey, you're...\n
Soma, aren't you?\n
You must be him.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Y-yes, but...\n
Who are you... ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Oh, forgive me.\n
I'm Yoko Belnades.\n
I'm a member of the church.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
How would a member\n
of the church recognize\n
me?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
You've met Aluca... um, \n
I mean, Genya... Arikado,\n
right?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I did meet him, but...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
He told me about you, and\n
asked me to help you if \n
you were in trouble. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Arikado said that?\n
That's hard to \n
believe.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Well, he may seem cold at \n
first, but he's actually\n
quite a decent guy.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
He may be looking out for\n
you because you share the\n
same dark powers.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wait, wait!\n
Did you say my powers\n
are "dark"?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Oh, you mean you\n
didn't know that!?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Uhh...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Oh, no... did I say \n
something...I...well...\n
what's said is said.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Essentially, you have \n
the power to rule over\n
and command monsters.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Rule over monsters?\n
I have no desire to \n
do that...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
It comes as naturally as\n
breathing for you, so you\n
may not realize it yet.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And though I called it\n
a "dark power," that\n
doesn't mean it's evil.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
It's like a weapon. Its\n
user decides whether to\n
use it for good or evil.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Well, when you put it \n
that way, I feel a little \n
bit better.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Since I got this power,\n
I've begun to lose my\n
sense of self.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
You are yourself.\n
There's no one else\n
you could be.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Don't second guess\n
yourself. Be confident. \n
That's most important.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I think I understand now. \n
Thanks, Yoko.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
(giggle)\n
I'm not used to being\n
thanked by people...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Oh, I forgot to ask you.\n
Have you seen\n
a man named Graham?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Graham?\n
Yes, I met him\n
earlier.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Be wary of that man. I \n
believe that he will\n
inherit Dracula's powers.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
No way!\n
He did not look like\n
a bad guy.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Right, and I've got\n
a bridge to sell you!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Don't be fooled by his \n
appearance! He's not\n
who you think he is.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Al...alright.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Well, I must be going.  \n
I've got to find Graham!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
See you around!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x07}
Strange... I sense a \n
dark power within\n
you... Who are you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
It is rude to ask questions\n
before introducing yourself.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Yes, you're right.\n
I can't give you my name,\n
but people call me J.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
People call you "J"? \n
Why hide your real name?\n
Are you a criminal?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}No. I have amnesia.\n
I'm told that I was in an\n
accident in 1999.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When I woke up in the\n
hospital, I had forgotten \n
my name and my past.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oh, I see...\n
Well, my name's Soma. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Your dark power...?\n
Were you born with it?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I don't really know.\n
I first noticed it when\n
I entered this castle...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}I see...\n
I guess I was mistaken.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Mr. J, why have you come\n
to this castle?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Call me J.\n
I am filled with fear when\n
I hear the name Dracula.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I came here because of \n
the prophecy.  I also thought\n
my memory might return.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
In fact, since my arrival,\n
I have felt like my \n
memory is returning.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
And your accident \n
occurred in 1999...? Maybe\n
Dracula was involved...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}I fear you are correct...\n
Especially since I have\n
magical powers...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
J, are you an exorcist?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Well, you might say that.\n
But I work for no one \n
but myself.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I must be going now.\n
I'm sure we'll meet\n
again.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yes, see ya...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
So we meet again!\n
I'm glad to see you're\n
unscathed.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Good to see you, too.\n
Uh... I've got something\n
I want to ask you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Sure, go ahead.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Someone told me that YOU\n
are to inherit Dracula's\n
powers...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
I take it that lady\n
from the church told\n
you that, didn't she? \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
It's not true, is it?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
The term 'inherit' is\n
incorrect.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
It's true then!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
I was born on the very\n
day that Dracula was\n
destroyed...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
So, in short, that means\n
that I AM Dracula!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
That can't be right!?\n
You've been so kind and\n
friendly to me!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
That is because I don't\n
consider you a \n
threat to my mission.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But that being said, you\n
have made it this far... I\n
sense a power within you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Do tell me... what\n
kind of power has awoken\n
within you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
.........\n
The power to rule...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
WHAT!?\n
You foolish boy!\n
That's impossible!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Huh?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
I can't remain here\n
any longer. I must\n
get to the throne!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Your name is Soma, right?\n
You are wrong, Soma!\n
I will not allow you to rule!!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Jeez. What was that all about?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Hello, Soma.\n
{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hey, Yoko.\n
I just ran into Graham.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
REALLY?\n
Which way did he go?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
He was in a rush to get\n
to the throne...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Just as I thought. There\n
is something important\n
in the Throne Room.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I'm sorry, Yoko.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Wha...what's wrong\n
with you all of a sudden?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
He's not who I thought\n
he was.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
He was kind to me only\n
because he thought I\n
was powerless.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
I see...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
But his attitude changed \n
suddenly when I told him\n
about my power.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Well, in his mind, he\n
thinks everything in this\n
castle is his...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
So that's the reason?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
But it's better this way.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What is?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
The fact that he sees you\n
as an enemy now means\n
you're my comrade.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Does it?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
What?\n
You don't want to be \n
on my side?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
No, that's not what I \n
meant...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Ha ha ha.\n
It's so much fun to tease \n
you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But this is not the time to\n
be fooling around.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Your presence here has \n
thrown Graham into a \n
panic. This is our chance.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What sort of chance?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Using his cunning mind,\n
he's been able to evade\n
us up until now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I don't think anyone has \n
ever seen him panic \n
before.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I get it. Circumstances\n
right now are making him\n
act this way...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
That's exactly right.\n
This is an excellent\n
opportunity to trap him.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Well, I must be on my way.\n
See you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
?!\n

If you're OK, say\n
something! Anything!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
I'm... al...alright.\n
Thank you... for\n
rescuing me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Graham, that bastard! \n
What has he done?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
He has... absorbed this\n
castle's power... and \n
he's gotten much stronger.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Oww, aaah...\n
My plan has... \n
failed...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Save your strength!\n
There's no need to\n
speak!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Be... cautious of him...\n
But d-don't... \n
overexert... yourself...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What?! YOKO!!! Oh, she's \n
just unconscious...\n
She's still breathing.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
I underestimated the \n
amount of power he \n
acquired...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Don't just stand there\n
mumbling!\n
Yoko's in bad shape!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Go!\n
I will see to her wounds.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I can't just leave her\n
like this! She's my \n
friend!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Do not worry about her. \n
I believe there are other\n
things you need to do.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Graham went to the \n
throne. What's there? What\n
are you hiding from me?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
I cannot say. You must\n
go there yourself.\n
And if you don't...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
you will lose Mina...\n
and Yoko as well! Their\n
fate is in your hands!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Damn you! I...don't like\n
your attitude, but I\n
don't think you're lying.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I feel as if I'm being \n
manipulated. I don't like\n
it, but I'll do as you say.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But if we ever escape\n
from this castle alive, I\n
want to know everything.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Fair enough.\n
Now be on your way.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Ohhh...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
J, what's wrong?\n
You look pale.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}D-don't worry... just \n
now... all of my memories \n
came flooding back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What!?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}It seems that your\n
dark power triggered the \n
return of my memories.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Just like I guessed...\n
I have quite an extensive\n
history with Dracula.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I thought so...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
My real name is\n
Julius Belmont...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I am a descendant of a \n
clan that has fought\n
against Dracula for ages.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
And the person who\n
destroyed Dracula in\n
1999 was...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Yes. It was me...\n
but there were others\n
who assisted me...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
So, if Dracula is revived\n
again, just as it is written\n
in the prophecy...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Then I must destroy him!\n
It is my destiny.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
You haven't met a man \n
named Graham yet, have \n
you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Graham?\n
Oh, you mean that\n
missionary, right?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I met him a little while\n
ago. But when he saw my\n
face, he turned and ran.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
He told me that he\n
was Dracula.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
I did sense Dracula's\n
powers at work within\n
him...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
but it's difficult to \n
believe that he's \n
Dracula... rather...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I think... No, forget it.\n
It is nothing more than a \n
hunch.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Huh?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Assuming that he is\n
Dracula, I won't be\n
able to kill him yet.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Why not?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
I need my weapon.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Your weapon?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Yes. It's a whip that was\n
handed down to me. It's \n
called "Vampire Killer."\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
In 1999, I sealed it in this\n
castle to weaken his \n
spirit and magical powers.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
That means it's in \n
this castle somewhere?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Yes. And I know exactly\n
where it is. I'll go and\n
get it now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Alright.\n
Please be careful.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Pray that my hunch\n
proves to be wrong.\n
Farewell for now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
You're too late, Soma!\n
Dracula's power is \n
already in my grasp.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Dracula's power doesn't\n
concern me!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I came here to find a\n
way out of this castle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
With my new abilities, I\n
can get you out of here\n
quite easily...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You, however, have some\n
property of mine in your \n
possession.  \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
The souls of  MY demons are\n
under YOUR control. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
Can I forgive such a crime?\n
NO! NEVER!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
If I knew how, I'd return\n
them all to you right \n
here and now!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
Even if you return them,\n
you have still committed \n
the crime of stealing. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Don't you know that?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
It's only right that\n
thieves receive the\n
punishment they deserve.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
You are one selfish\n
bastard!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
You're guilty of grand \n
theft. Therefore, I\n
sentence you to death!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
You're insane!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
And, as a special treat,\n
I myself will deliver the\n
punishment!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
I can't believe it...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I haven't lost yet...\n
You still don't have \n
Dracula's power.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I'll show you!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
Tha...that's not... NOOO!!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
The magical powers he \n
absorbed have \n
abandoned him.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
The castle is weak now!\n
The portal to your world\n
should be opening!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
So what should I do?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Order the castle to open\n
the portal!  It has felt \n
your power and may obey!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Alright. I'll give it a \n
try. I command you...\n
to open!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{NEXTACTION}
Return all of us living\n
beings to where we \n
came from!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
Nothing happened...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
You're wrong.\n
The fabric of space is\n
beginning to tear...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
I can't believe it...\n
How did YOU come to \n
possess those powers?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What do you mean \n
by "those powers"?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
I'm Dracula.\n
And you're not the one!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x08}{NAME 0x04}
Nooo! this cannot be!!!\n
Does this mean that\n
I'm not Dracula?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wha...what's this?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Whoa, something is...\n
flowing into me!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{NEXTACTION}
NO, WAIT!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
PLEASE... STOP!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
NOOOOOOO!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Finally... I clearly\n
understand... everything.\n
I am... Dracula.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
This is like a bad joke.\n
Come on out, Arikado.\n
I know you're here.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Why did you force me to \n
awaken!?\n
I was just fine as I was.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Yes, you weren't supposed \n
to come to this castle \n
in the first place.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Then why did you make me\n
come here!?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Your soul and Dracula's\n
magical powers are one \n
and the same.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
No matter what we did,\n
this day was\n
destined to come.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
That being so, I decided\n
to awaken you somewhere\n
I could use MY powers.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Huh?\n
What do you mean?\n
I don't understand.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Because you are now one\n
with him, an evil spirit\n
must be flowing into you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Yes. It started not too\n
long ago, and it's \n
slowly filling me up...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I'm doing all that I can\n
to keep from being\n
consumed by it.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Once you have finished\n
absorbing all of it, his \n
powers will be yours.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You will then become the\n
evil count... I do not \n
want to let that happen!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Neither do I!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
I know. That is why I chose\n
the dangerous route.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
The dangerous route?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
The evil in this spirit \n
comes from those who seek\n
chaos and destruction.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
So we need to cut off the \n
source of the chaos\n
influencing the spirit.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Is that possible?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
This castle is a product \n
of Dracula's magic. It's\n
a spiritual world.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
My point is this... a \n
stream of chaos exists \n
within this castle as well.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
There is a place where\n
only you, Dracula, can go.\n
That's where the chaos is!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
I'll go, I'm not \n
afraid... but what do I\n
do once I get there?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
You'll have to stop it\n
using your own strength.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You already succeeded\n
in reaching the throne.\n
I'm sure you can do it.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
If it will make me myself \n
again, I'll do whatever\n
it takes.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
As long as my powers\n
continue to affect this \n
place, the flow of the \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
evil spirit into you \n
will be slowed down.\n
Go quickly!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
I'm going... \n
I appreciate your\n
help...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
There is a place where\n
only you, Dracula, can go.\n
That's where the chaos is!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
GO NOW!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Stop!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Julius?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
So you were the one.\n
I didn't want to believe\n
it was true...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
It's true. I am Dracula.\n
But I'm not what you\n
think I am!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
I must destroy Dracula\n
at any cost.\n
That is my destiny.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
NO, WAIT!\n
I don't want to fight\n
against you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Nothing you can say will\n
stop me! \n
Prepare to die!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
STOP!\n
I'VE HAD ENOUGH!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Wh...why...\n
Why won't you finish me \n
off?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
You took it easy on me.\n
I could tell. The \n
strength of a Belmont...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
No... the strength of a \n
vampire hunter is greater\n
than this.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
.......\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When I fought you, I \n
felt the evil spirit within \n
you. But there's more...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I also sensed Soma's \n
spirit. And that's more\n
than enough to stop me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
..........\n
I've got a favor to ask\n
of you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
What is it?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
From here, I will set off \n
to fight against my own \n
fate.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
If I lose the battle...\n
and I become the\n
reincarnation of evil,\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I want you to kill me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
........\n
I will...\n
I promise.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Thanks... now I can \n
go into this battle \n
without reservations.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Farewell, my friend.\n
Don't let me use \n
that whip again.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}		{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
I'm finally here...\n
I wonder if I can do  \n
this alone...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
You're not alone.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Wha...what?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Everyone remaining in the\n
castle combined their \n
powers to contact you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Does that mean\n
they all know...\n
that I'm Dracula?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes...\n
Arikado told us\n
everything...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
I bet they're all afraid\n
of me...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
No, not at all!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
At first, we were shocked, \n
but everyone believes\n
you'll get through this.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I'm going to send you a \n
message from them now.\n
Listen...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
You'll visit my shop\n
again, won't ya?\n
I'll be waitin' for ya.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Good morning, Soma.\n
I just heard about what\n
happened to you...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I told you this before...\n
You are who you are, and\n
you mustn't let him win.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
To the man who beat\n
me... don't disappoint\n
me now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
This is your last chance,\n
and ours as well.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I'm counting on you...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
They're all...\n
rooting for me...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You can do it...\n
because I believe in you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Alright, here I go!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Have we returned?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes, there's no mistake. \n
We've made it home. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Excellent...\n
You've done well.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hey, what happened to the\n
others? \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
No need to worry about \n
them. They'll be here\n
soon enough.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
And the castle...\n
is the castle still in\n
the eclipse?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Yes.\n
It awaits the coming \n
of its new master.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Someday, someone will\n
assume the form of\n
Dracula again.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When that time will be,\n
I do not know...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What's wrong, Soma?\n
We made it back home.  \n
Why the sad face?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I feel like the castle\n
is still calling out to\n
me...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Maybe the castle is\n
where I truly belong...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
You're imagining things.\n
We just escaped from\n
there. You are home...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah, I hope it's just\n
my imagination...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
If you are ever summoned  \n
by the castle again, you \n
can deal with it then.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
For now, you should rest.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah, you're right...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
It's all over...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
The evil spirit is fading\n
away...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Hello, Soma.\n
Congratulations.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I've got another job that\n
I must attend to, so I\n
have to go now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When I heard that YOU\n
were Dracula, I was\n
shocked...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I was also just waking\n
up, you know.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
If you think about it, \n
though, everything turned\n
out OK. Ha ha ha...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
...\n
I'll never forget your\n
strength and courage.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And I haven't thanked you\n
yet for rescuing me.\n
So...thanks.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You're like a younger\n
brother to me. It was fun,\n
and I hope we meet again.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Goodbye.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hey there! Much obliged \n
for your business at my \n
shop.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Back at the castle, I \n
realized my true calling.\n
Fighting's not for me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I think I'll quit the army\n
and open up a shop\n
sometime soon.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Promise me you'll come.\n
I'll give ya a good\n
deal. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
You fought well.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When we fled the castle,\n
I felt the power from\n
Vampire Killer fading away.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I don't know what that means.\n
But I won't have to do anything\n
for the time being.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Farewell.\n
May we meet again.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
The path you took was \n
the most challenging\n
one. You did well.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
For God to be good,\n
evil is an absolute \n
necessity in this world.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
In the future, someone\n
may follow again in \n
Dracula's dark footsteps.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
At that time, perhaps\n
we'll meet again.\n
Farewell...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
In my mother's name, I\n
send thanks to you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
...Wake up...\n
Wake up...Wake...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Wake up...\n
Wake up, Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Uh, ungh...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma! Oh, thank God!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I was so worried about\n
you...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Arikado told me that you would\n
be okay, but I was worried. I\n
thought you would never wake up.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I heard everybody's voices...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You saved my life...again!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
AGAIN?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yes... I couldn't have\n
won the last battle by\n
myself.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Everyone's kind words and\n
encouragement led me to\n
victory...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm so glad that\n
your experience \n
didn't change you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
But it DID change me...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
In what way?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I'm a lot cooler now!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yeah... you HAVE changed.\n
The old Soma would \n
never have said that.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Remember, inside of me, \n
Dracula's power lies \n
sleeping. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
It may not be evil anymore, \n
but, it's definitely changed me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
It's OK. If anything ever\n
happens again, everyone \n
will rush to your aid.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
That's right. I guess\n
they will. Look, the\n
eclipse has ended!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Your kind words gave me \n
the strength to win...\n
Thanks...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Wake up...\n
Wake up, Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Uh, ungh...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Thank god, you woke up.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Heard you folks speak.\n
 I was saved by you all again.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Again?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yes... I couldn't have\n
won the last battle by\n
myself.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Everyone's kind words and\n
encouragement led me to\n
victory...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Remember, inside of me, \n
Dracula's power lies \n
sleeping. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
It's not evil, but...\n
it's definitely changed me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
It's OK. If anything ever\n
happens again, everyone \n
will rush to your aid.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
That's right. I guess\n
they will. Look, the\n
eclipse has ended.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x07}
Oh! What's a child like\n
yerself doing in a place\n
like this?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
A child?\n
You're rude, grandpa.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Oh, my apologies. My \n
name's Hammer. The army \n
ordered me to come here.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hi. I'm Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
I thought I was inspecting\n
a shrine, but suddenly\n
I was in a castle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Don't ya think that's a\n
mean thing to do to a\n
guy?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
So I just bailed on\n
my mission.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What do you mean?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
There were a bunch of \n
strange people gathered\n
at the shrine.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I thought they'd be\n
good customers, so\n
I opened up a shop.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ahhh...\n
Good for you...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
There're weapons all \n
over this castle and no\n
monsters at the front gate. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Good place for a\n
shop! Come on by! \n
I'll give ya a good deal.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
See ya around!\n
Wah hah hah ha...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
A shop, huh?\n
I don't get it...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Howdy there. Ya came.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Is this where you've\n
opened your shop?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Yes, yes it is.\n
By the way, that cute\n
young lady over there...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
She's staring at you.\n
Is she yer friend?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Whoa! I had no idea you\n
were so popular with the\n
ladies.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
H-Hey, it's not like that!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Don't be shy now, ya \n
hear? It's good to be \n
young! It's a good thing!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Alrighty, back to\n
business... Take a look \n
around, friend!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hey, welcome back!\n
By the way, do ya know\n
Arikado? \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah, sort of.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Is that weird fella a\n
friend of yers, too? Yer\n
more popular than I \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
thought. Don't much like\n
people like that!\n
So, what can I sell ya?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hey, that woman back \n
there...she OK?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I don't know.\n
She's been wounded\n
pretty badly...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
The medicine I have\n
won't help much...hope \n
she'll be alright...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah, me too.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Know why I say that? \n
Cause she's my type...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Well, I gotta business to\n
run...\n
What would ya like?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hey, you...\n
Ya seem different.\n
Did something happen?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
N-No...\n
Nothing happened...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Really?\n
If you say so...\n
What can I get ya?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Welcome back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Mina!\n
Are you doing OK?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes, I'm fine. It seems\n
like the monsters can't \n
get in here anymore.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Arikado said\n
he'd put up a\n
protective barrier...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And while we're on\n
the subject...\n
just who is Arikado?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm not sure. I heard he \n
does something related to\n
national intelligence.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
National intelligence?\n
Sounds like he's a spy.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
He's been coming to the\n
shrine for many years.\n
He's an unusual man.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What makes him so \n
unusual?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
The face of a normal \n
person changes as the \n
years pass, right?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yes, people change as \n
they grow older.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
In the ten years\n
I've known him, he\n
hasn't changed at all.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Are you sure it's not\n
just your imagination?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
It's could be, but...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
His face is just too \n
beautiful. He's almost \n
perfect.  Don't you agree?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
So you're saying that\n
he's your type, right?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What are you talking \n
about! I like guys who\n
are...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
.......\n
That's none of your \n
business, OK?! \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
It was just a joke.\n
Why are you taking\n
things so seriously?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
F-forget it... Don't you \n
think it would be better \n
if you stayed here, too?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
No. In order to get us out\n
of here, there's something\n
I've been told I must do.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Aside from that, I've  \n
discovered that I, too, \n
have magical powers.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
(Maybe it's best I don't\n
mention the danger of\n
staying here too long...)\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I understand...\n
But please be careful.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I will.\n
Mina...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Do you trust me?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Of course I do!\n
I know that you would \n
never lie to me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
If that's true, then please\n
wait here. I promise\n
I'll get you back home.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
OK, don't worry about me.\n
I can wait as long as you \n
need me to.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Alright, I'll be back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Don't get yourself\n
hurt, OK?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
OK.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Welcome back, Soma.\n
Hey...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
What?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
That man over there...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Who? You mean \n
Hammer?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
His name's Hammer,\n
huh? Don't you think \n
he's a little scary?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
No, I think he's a\n
decent guy.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
But look at all those\n
weapons he has\n
over there...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
He told me he was\n
opening up his own\n
shop.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Here!? He's opening a\n
shop in this castle? \n
He's weird...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah, it's pretty \n
strange...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
But if you say that he's\n
a good guy...\n
I'll believe you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Oh! Soma.\n
I wonder if Yoko \n
will be alright...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Do you know Yoko?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes... She's been coming \n
to my house since I was \n
very young.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Because I'm an only \n
child, she's been like a \n
big sister to me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I see... Did Arikado bring\n
her here?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes, he did.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Then I'm sure she's OK.\n
He said not to worry\n
about her.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
He was confident he could\n
save her. That's why he \n
brought her here.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
If you say that she'll be\n
fine, I believe you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I know this is tough for\n
you, but hang in there...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
OK.\n
Leave it to me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Welcome back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
How's Yoko doing?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
She's still unconscious.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
She looks like she's in\n
a lot of pain.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Once in a while, she\n
cries out in pain.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I see...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Welcome back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
How are you holding up?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm perfectly fine.\n
Thanks for asking.\n
	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm a bit tired...\n
But it's nothing for you \n
to worry about.\n
	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm alright.  I know you're \n
worried about me. That\n
makes me feel special.\n
	{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Lately, I've had some\n
really bad headaches.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
My body feels really \n
heavy at times.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Sometimes I just feel so \n
uneasy waiting here.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Will you be alright?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes.\n
No need to worry,\n
I'm fine.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Lately, I've been\n
feeling strange...\n
I'm soooo exhausted...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Well, I... I've been\n
passing out occasionally. \n
I get so dizzy, then...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Sometimes I lose control\n
of my arms and legs...\n
What's wrong with me?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Are you sure you will be OK?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm sorry I worried you.\n
I'm sure I'll be fine.\n
Waiting here is easy.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
If you say so, but...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
(I must find an escape\n
route... and quickly!)\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Wel...welcome back.\n
You're Soma, aren't you...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What happened to you?\n
You look so... scary.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
N-nothing happened.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
(I don't want her to\n
know the truth!)\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
OK, then...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Hey, Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
If I weren't Soma anymore,\n
how would you feel?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Wha...what's wrong with\n
you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Listen. If I...\n
If I looked like me, \n
but... \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
If, on the inside, I was\n
someone else... how would\n
that make you feel?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
What the hell am I saying?\n
Forget what I just said, \n
Mina, OK?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Hmm, I might not like you\n
anymore. And that look\n
in your eyes scares me...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I'd rather see your exterior\n
changed, but not the\n
inside...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
Please forgive me if I \n
ever change...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
.......\n
What do you mean\n
"forgive you"?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
It's n-nothing...\n
I must leave now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
No!\n
Soma, WAIT!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What's wrong, Soma?\n
You've been acting\n
strange recently.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Th...that's not true.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
It's not like you to hide\n
something from me!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
Sorry... But \n
I just can't\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
tell you this.\n
I've got to go.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Welcome back.\n
I have a message\n
for you from Arikado.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
From Arikado?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes, it's, ah...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}	When the speed at which \n
you fall slows, you'll be\n
able to jump farther.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Try imagining that \n
you're gliding through \n
the air...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	When you're able to swap\n
your HP and your \n
MP, there is an enemy\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
you'll be able to defeat\n
instantly. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I don't really\n
understand it, but...\n
this helps you, right?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	If you run at full speed \n
on the surface of the\n
water, with your strong\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
body, you could break \n
through the water wall. \n
What does that mean?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Maybe impossible for \n
human to do? \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	I hear there is an enemy\n
that moves at extremely\n
high speeds. He's so fast\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
he's invisible. If you\n
could stop time, perhaps\n
you could see him.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Somewhere in the castle,\n
there's a monster that\n
can stop time.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I've also heard there are \n
some monsters immune to \n
being frozen in time.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	If you stand on the water\n
and jump from that spot,\n
you'll be able to go up there.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Stand on the water, what\n
does that mean? Maybe you \n
have to act like a ninja?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	There is an area\n
accessible by traveling \n
through water.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Without scuba gear, it \n
may be too tough for\n
a human to handle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	When you look up and see\n
a demon at the altar, \n
there's something else \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
there as well.\n
Demon at the altar, what\n
do you think that is?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	There should be ancient books\n
that talk about Dracula's \n
power hidden somewhere \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
in this castle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I wonder what they are about.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	I hear that some space is\n
tweaked here in the castle. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And some connected to \n
different spots.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
In short, in some places, \n
you cannot return to the spot \n
where you came from.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I see...\n

Come back again later.\n
Maybe I'll have another\n
message from Arikado.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I'll check back with you\n
whenever I can.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hmm... it doesn't make \n
any sense.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What's wrong, Soma?\n
You've been acting\n
strange recently.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Th...that's not true.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
It's not like you to hide\n
something from me!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
Sorry... But \n
I just can't\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
tell you this.\n
I've got to go.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Welcome back.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hey, Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
What's up?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
It's kind of late to ask,\n
but what kind of shrine\n
is the Hakuba Shrine?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma, do you know the\n
story of the Amanoiwado\n
Shrine?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I think I've heard it \n
before.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
In the story, Tensho Daijin\n
hides herself in the shrine\n
to calm Susanoo down.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yeah, I remember now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Tensho Daijin is the sun. \n
The act of hiding\n
symbolizes an eclipse.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
By hiding herself away,\n
she was able to contain \n
Susanoo's anger.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
For that reason, eclipses \n
are thought to confine\n
anger and evil intentions.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes, people have prayed\n
to eclipses for \n
centuries.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And the Hakuba Shrine \n
is a shrine for this very\n
purpose.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I understand now...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
And usually, we only \n
conduct ceremonies for \n
Japan's eclipses, but...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
In 1999, a ritual was \n
conducted in Europe...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Yes...\n
That's what I was told.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
And that's when Dracula's\n
castle was sealed\n
inside it...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
That's why I knew the \n
things that Mr. Arikado \n
said were...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yes, I know now that\n
he spoke the truth.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
I'm sorry.\n
I haven't been much\n
help to you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
That's not true, I feel a\n
bit relieved now.\n
Thanks, Mina.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
.......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
She appears to be \n
asleep...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
I wonder if she'll \n
ever regain \n
consciousness.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yoko, please don't die...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}		{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Dracula is--!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Whoa...\n
she is just hallucinating...\n
I thought she knew...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Sorry I kept you waiting.\n
Time to keep that promise\n
I made you.\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Comment {RAW 0xE7}a ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Il y avait un groupe de \n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
J'ai pens{RAW 0xE9} qu'ils feraient\n

Est-ce que {RAW 0xE7}a va ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Oui, {RAW 0xE7}a va. On dirait que\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Arikado a dit qu'il allait\n

Puisqu'on aborde ce\n

Il vient au temple depuis\n
de nombreuses ann{RAW 0xE9}es.\n
Il est {RAW 0xE9}trange.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Pourquoi dis-tu qu'il est\n
{RAW 0xE9}trange ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Le visage des gens \n
change avec les ann{RAW 0xE9}es,\n
n'est-ce pas ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oui, les gens changent\n
en vieillissant.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Depuis dix ans que je le\n

Tu es s{RAW 0xFB}re que ce n'est \n

Son visage est si beau.\n
Il est presque parfait,\n

Tu veux dire qu'il est ton\n

C'est une blague.\n
Pourquoi le prends-tu si\n

D-d{RAW 0xE9}sol{RAW 0xE9}e... Tu ne crois \n
pas qu'il vaudrait mieux \n
que tu restes ici aussi ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Non. Pour que l'on sorte\n
d'ici, j'ai quelque chose\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}

Mais sois prudent.\n

Bien s{RAW 0xFB}r !\n
Je sais que tu ne me\n

ici. Je te promets de te\n
ramener {RAW 0xE0} la maison.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
OK, ne t'en fais pas pour\n
moi. J'attendrai le temps\n
qu'il faudra.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
D'accord, je reviens.\n

Non, je crois que c'est un\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Ce... ce n'est pas vrai.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
{RAW 0xC7}a ne te ressemble pas de\n
me cacher les choses !\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
D{RAW 0xE9}sol{RAW 0xE9}... mais je ne peux\n
pas te le dire.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Il faut que je m'en aille.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma !\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Rebonjour.\n
J'ai un message pour toi\n
de la part d'Arikado.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
De la part d'Arikado ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Oui, c'est, ah...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}	Quand la vitesse {RAW 0xE0}  \n
laquelle tu tombes chute, \n
tu peux sauter plus loin.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Essaie d'imaginer que tu\n
glisses dans les airs...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Si tu peux {RAW 0xE9}changer tes\n
HP et tes MP, il y a un\n
ennemi que tu peux \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
vaincre instantan{RAW 0xE9}ment.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Je ne le comprends pas\n
vraiment, mais {RAW 0xE7}a t'est \n
utile, non ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Si tu cours tr{RAW 0xE8}s vite {RAW 0xE0} la\n
surface de l'eau, avec ton\n
corps puissant, tu peux\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
rompre le mur d'eau.\n
Qu'est-ce que {RAW 0xE7}a signifie ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
C'est peut-{RAW 0xEA}tre impossible \n
pour les humains ? \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Un ennemi se d{RAW 0xE9}place {RAW 0xE0}\n
tr{RAW 0xE8}s grande vitesse. Il est\n
tellement rapide qu'il est\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
invisible. Si tu r{RAW 0xE9}ussis {RAW 0xE0}\n
arr{RAW 0xEA}ter le temps, tu \n
le verras peut-{RAW 0xEA}tre.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Quelque part dans le \n
ch{RAW 0xE2}teau, un monstre peut\n
arr{RAW 0xEA}ter le temps.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
J'ai aussi entendu parler\n
de monstres insensibles\n
au gel du temps.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Si tu te tiens sur l'eau et\n
que tu sautes, tu pourras\n
monter.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Sur l'eau, qu'est-ce que {RAW 0xE7}a\n
veut dire ? Peut-{RAW 0xEA}tre\n
agir comme un ninja ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Il y a une zone accessible\n
en voyageant dans l'eau.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Sans combinaison, {RAW 0xE7}a \n
risque d'{RAW 0xEA}tre trop difficile\n
pour un humain.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Quand tu l{RAW 0xE8}ves la t{RAW 0xEA}te et \n
que tu vois un d{RAW 0xE9}mon sur \n
l'autel, il y a aussi autre\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
chose. Le d{RAW 0xE9}mon sur \n
l'autel, c'est quoi, d'apr{RAW 0xE8}s\n
toi ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Il doit y avoir des livres \n
anciens sur le pouvoir \n
cach{RAW 0xE9} de Dracula quelque \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
part dans ce ch{RAW 0xE2}teau.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Je me demande de quoi\n
ils traitent.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Le ch{RAW 0xE2}teau contient des\n
espaces {RAW 0xE0} explorer. \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Certains sont connect{RAW 0xE9}s \n
{RAW 0xE0} diff{RAW 0xE9}rents points.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Dans certains endroits, \n
il est impossible de \n
retourner d'o{RAW 0xF9} on vient.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Je vois...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Reviens plus tard.\n
J'aurai peut-{RAW 0xEA}tre un autre\n
message d'Arikado.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Je viendrai te voir d{RAW 0xE8}s\n
que je le pourrai.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hum... {RAW 0xC7}a ne veut rien\n
dire.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas,\n
Soma ? Tu es vraiment \n
bizarre en ce moment.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Ce... ce n'est pas vrai.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
{RAW 0xC7}a ne te ressemble pas de\n
me cacher les choses !\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
D{RAW 0xE9}sol{RAW 0xE9}... Mais je ne peux\n
pas t'en parler.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Il faut que j'y aille.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma !\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Rebonjour.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
H{RAW 0xE9}, Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Quoi de neuf ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Tu me poses la question\n
un peu tard, mais comment\n
est le Temple de Hakuba ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma, connais-tu l'histoire\n
du Temple \n
d'Amanoiwado ?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Je crois que je l'ai d{RAW 0xE9}j{RAW 0xE0}\n
entendue.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Tensho Daijin se serait\n
cach{RAW 0xE9}e dans le temple\n
pour calmer Susanoo.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oui, {RAW 0xE7}a me revient.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Tensho Daijin est le soleil. \n
Le fait de se cacher\n
symbolise l'{RAW 0xE9}clipse.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
En se cachant, elle a pu \n
contenir la col{RAW 0xE8}re de\n
Susanoo.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
On pense donc que les \n
{RAW 0xE9}clipses emprisonnent\n
la col{RAW 0xE8}re et le mal.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Oui, les gens v{RAW 0xE9}n{RAW 0xE8}rent les\n
{RAW 0xE9}clipses depuis des \n
si{RAW 0xE8}cles.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Et le Temple de Hakuba \n
a justement {RAW 0xE9}t{RAW 0xE9} {RAW 0xE9}rig{RAW 0xE9} {RAW 0xE0}\n
cet effet.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Je comprends \n
maintenant...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
En g{RAW 0xE9}n{RAW 0xE9}ral, on n'organise\n
des c{RAW 0xE9}r{RAW 0xE9}monies que pour\n
les {RAW 0xE9}clipses japonaises,\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
mais en 1999, un rituel \n
a {RAW 0xE9}t{RAW 0xE9} conduit en Europe...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Oui...\n
C'est ce qu'on m'a dit.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
C'est l'ann{RAW 0xE9}e o{RAW 0xF9} Dracula\n
a {RAW 0xE9}t{RAW 0xE9} enferm{RAW 0xE9} dans son\n
ch{RAW 0xE2}teau...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Je savais que les choses\n
racont{RAW 0xE9}es par M. Arikado  \n
{RAW 0xE9}taient...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Oui, je sais maintenant\n
qu'il disait la v{RAW 0xE9}rit{RAW 0xE9}.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Je suis d{RAW 0xE9}sol{RAW 0xE9}e.\n
Je ne t'ai pas beaucoup\n
aid{RAW 0xE9}.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ce n'est pas vrai. Je suis\n
un peu soulag{RAW 0xE9} \n
maintenant. Merci, Mina.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
.......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Elle a l'air endormie...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Je me demande si elle\n
reviendra jamais {RAW 0xE0} elle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yoko, ne meurs pas, je\n
t'en prie...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}		{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Dracula est-- !\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
......\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ouah...\n
Elle hallucine, c'est tout...\n
Je croyais qu'elle savait...\n

die Treppe zum Schrein wirkte\n
seltsamerweise l{RAW 0xE4}nger als sonst,\n
als wollte uns etwas von unserem\n

Schlie{RAW 0xDF}lich schaffte ich es, durch\n

Wieso? Na, Mina und ich -\n

Soll das etwa hei{RAW 0xDF}en, wir\n

Nein. Wir sind in der\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Was? Wer ist erwacht?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Der Geist des Wesens, das\n
du get{RAW 0xF6}tet hast, ist in\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Du hast die Macht, die\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Du hast sie erworben.\n
Geh jetzt zum Zimmer\n

Geh zum Zimmer des\n

Aber ich kann Mina doch\n
nicht hier zur{RAW 0xFC}cklassen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Mach dir keine Sorgen um\n

Ja. Nur du kannst sie\n

Und du, was machst \n

Du warst noch nie in\n

Wie bist du hergekommen?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Keine Ahnung. Ich ging\n
durch das Tor, und\n
schwupps war ich da.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Ich verstehe...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
{RAW 0xC4}h, kann ich mal\n
was fragen?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Nur zu!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ist das hier wirklich\n
Draculas Schloss?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Aber sicher.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Aber ist Draculas\n
Schloss nicht irgendwo\n
in Europa?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Theoretisch ja, aber \n
sein wahres Schloss\n
existiert woanders.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Sein wahres Schloss?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Ja. Das wei{RAW 0xDF} jeder in\n
der Unterwelt. Glaubst\n
du an Vampire?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
{RAW 0xC4}hm, nein. Eigentlich\n
hielt ich Dracula immer\n
f{RAW 0xFC}r ein M{RAW 0xE4}rchen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Nun, es ist alles wahr.\n
Die Kunde davon geriet\n
leider in die Au{RAW 0xDF}enwelt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Normalerweise h{RAW 0xE4}lt die\n
Kirche diese Dinge\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
{RAW 0xDC}ber die Jahre ist\n
Dracula viele Male\n
auferstanden...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
wenn die Leute vom\n
Glauben abfielen, Chaos\n
und Zerst{RAW 0xF6}rung suchten...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Willst du mir jetzt etwa\n
erz{RAW 0xE4}hlen, dass Dracula\n
wieder auferstanden ist?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Nein.\n
Dracula ging\n
1999 zugrunde.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Du kennst doch die\n
Prophezeihung von\n
1999, oder?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Die gro{RAW 0xDF}e Prophezeihung\n
des Nostradamus...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Genau. Dracula ist\n
auferstanden, so wie er\n
es vorhergesagt hatte.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Aber Vampirj{RAW 0xE4}ger\n
haben ihn v{RAW 0xF6}llig\n
vernichtet.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Sie beendeten seinen\n
Regenerationszyklus,\n
als sie sein Schloss,\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Symbol der d{RAW 0xE4}monischen\n

der Eklipse versiegelten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Und wir befinden uns in\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Ja, aber das ist\n
noch nicht alles...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Was denn noch?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
"Im Jahre 2035 wird ein\n

Oh, Verzeihung.\n
Ich bin Yoko Belnades.\n

Wieso sollte ein\n

Du kennst doch Aluca...\n
{RAW 0xE4}h, ich meine Genya...\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Schon, aber...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Er erz{RAW 0xE4}hlte mir von dir.\n
Ich soll dir helfen, wenn\n
du Probleme hast.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Das soll Arikado \n
gesagt haben?\n
Schwer zu glauben.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Nun ja, er wirkt zuerst\n
kalt, ist aber eigentlich\n
ganz in Ordnung.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Vielleicht sorgt er sich\n
um dich, weil ihr beide\n
dunkle Kr{RAW 0xE4}fte besitzt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Moment mal! Hast du\n
gesagt, meine Kr{RAW 0xE4}fte\n
seien "dunkel"?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Ach, hast du das etwa\n
nicht gewusst!?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Uhh...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Oh nein... Hab ich da\n
was gesagt, was ich...\n
Naja, jetzt ist es raus.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Im Grunde hast du die\n
Macht, Ungeheuer zu\n
beherrschen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ungeheuer zu \n
beherrschen? Aber das\n
will ich gar nicht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Das ist so nat{RAW 0xFC}rlich wie\n
Atmen f{RAW 0xFC}r dich, darum\n
ist es dir nicht klar.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Und "dunkle Macht"\n
hei{RAW 0xDF}t nicht unbedingt,\n
dass sie b{RAW 0xF6}se ist.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Sie ist wie eine Waffe.\n
Der Benutzer nutzt sie\n
zum Guten oder B{RAW 0xF6}sen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wenn du's so erkl{RAW 0xE4}rst,\n
geht es mir schon\n
etwas besser.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Seit ich die Macht habe,\n
wei{RAW 0xDF} ich kaum noch,\n
wer ich bin.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Du bist du selbst.\n
Du k{RAW 0xF6}nntest niemand\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Zweifle nicht an dir.\n
Sei zuversichtlich. Das\n

Ich glaube, ich verstehe\n
jetzt. Danke, Yoko.\n

Nimm dich vor ihm in\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Bestimmt nicht! Der\n

Wie unh{RAW 0xF6}flich, andere\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Ich verstehe... Ich habe\n

Das hat dir wohl diese\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Es stimmt nicht, oder?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
"Erben" ist das \n
falsche Wort.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Dann stimmt es also!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}

Und das hei{RAW 0xDF}t:\n

Das kann doch nicht\n
stimmen!? Du warst\n
doch so nett zu mir!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x03}{NAME 0x04}
Weil ich dich nicht\n

Hey, Yoko. Hab grade\n
Graham getroffen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
WIRKLICH? Wo ist\n
er hingegangen?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Er hatte es eilig, zum\n
Thron zu kommen...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Dachte ich's mir doch.\n
Es ist etwas Wichtiges\n
im Thronraum.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Tut mir Leid, Yoko.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
W-was hast du \n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Er ist nicht der, f{RAW 0xFC}r den\n
ich ihn hielt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Er war nur nett zu mir,\n
weil er mich f{RAW 0xFC}r \n
schwach hielt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Ich verstehe...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Als ich ihm von meiner\n
Macht erz{RAW 0xE4}hlte, {RAW 0xE4}nderte\n
sich sein Verhalten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Naja, er glaubt, alles in\n
diesem Schloss geh{RAW 0xF6}re\n
ihm allein...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Das ist also der Grund?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Aber so ist es besser.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Was?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Dass er dich als Feind\n
betrachtet, hei{RAW 0xDF}t, du\n
stehst auf meiner Seite.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ach ja?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Was denn?\n
Willst du etwa nicht\n
auf meiner Seite sein?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Nein, so meinte ich\n
das nicht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Ha ha ha.\n
Ich ziehe dich einfach\n
so gerne auf!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Aber jetzt ist nicht\n
die Zeit dazu.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Graham ist in Panik,\n
weil du hier bist. Das\n
ist unsere Chance.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Was f{RAW 0xFC}r eine Chance?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Er ist sehr gerissen,\n
daher konnte er uns\n
bis jetzt entkommen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Bisher hat ihn, glaube\n
ich, noch nie jemand \n
in Panik gesehen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Schon kapiert. Deshalb\n
wird er sich jetzt \n
anders verhalten...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Genau. Eine prima\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Tja, ich muss los.\n

Mir g-geht's gut...\n

Graham, dieser Mist-\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Er hat... die Macht des\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Auu, aaah...\n
Mein Plan ist...\n
fehlgeschlagen...\n

Spar deine Kr{RAW 0xE4}fte!\n
Du solltest jetzt nicht\n

Ich habe die Macht\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Nun steh doch nicht so\n

Geh! Ich k{RAW 0xFC}mmere\n

Ich kann sie nicht \n

Sorg dich nicht um sie.\n
Du hast Anderes\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Graham ist zum Thron\n
gegangen. Was ist dort?\n
Was verschweigst du?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Ich kann es nicht sagen.\n
Du musst selbst dort\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
verlierst du Mina... Und\n
Yoko auch! Ihr Schicksal\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}

aber ich glaube nicht,\n
dass du mich anl{RAW 0xFC}gst.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Aber wenn wir je lebend\n

will ich alles wissen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Das ist nur fair. Jetzt\n
mach dich auf den Weg.\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x06}Anscheinend regte\n
deine dunkle Macht \n
mein Ged{RAW 0xE4}chtnis an.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Es stimmt also...\n
Ich hatte ziemlich viel\n
mit Dracula zu tun.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Das dachte ich mir...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Mein wahrer Name ist\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich entstamme einer\n
Sippe, die schon lange\n

Und der Mann, der\n

Ja. Das war ich...\n
Aber andere haben\n
mir dabei geholfen...\n

Wenn Dracula also laut\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Muss ich ihn t{RAW 0xF6}ten!\n
Das ist mein Schicksal.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hast du mal jemanden\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Graham?\n
Ach, du meinst\n
diesen Missionar?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Den habe ich getroffen.\n
Als er mein Gesicht\n
sah, rannte er davon.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Er hat mir gesagt, er\n
sei Dracula.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Ich sp{RAW 0xFC}rte Draculas\n

Ich glaube... Nein, \n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Wenn er wirklich\n
Dracula ist, kann ich\n
ihn noch nicht t{RAW 0xF6}ten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wieso nicht?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Ich brauche meine Waffe.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Deine Waffe?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Ja. Eine Peitsche, die\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
In Ordnung.\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
W-warum... gibst du\n
mir nicht den Rest?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Du hast mich geschont.\n
Ich hab's gesp{RAW 0xFC}rt. Die\n
St{RAW 0xE4}rke eines Belmont...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Nein... Die St{RAW 0xE4}rke\n
eines Vampirj{RAW 0xE4}gers ist \n
gr{RAW 0xF6}{RAW 0xDF}er als dies.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Als ich mit dir k{RAW 0xE4}mpfte,\n
sp{RAW 0xFC}rte ich das B{RAW 0xF6}se in\n
dir. Aber da war mehr...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich sp{RAW 0xFC}rte auch Somas\n
Geist. Und das reichte,\n
um mich aufzuhalten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
Ich m{RAW 0xF6}chte dich um\n
einen Gefallen bitten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Welchen?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Von jetzt an werde ich\n
gegen mein eigenes\n
Schicksal ank{RAW 0xE4}mpfen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Wenn ich verliere... \n
und zur Reinkarnation\n
des B{RAW 0xF6}sen werde...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
dann t{RAW 0xF6}te mich!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
...\n
Das werde ich.\n
Ich verspreche es.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Danke... Jetzt kann ich\n
mich ohne Vorbehalte\n
in den Kampf st{RAW 0xFC}rzen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Mach's gut, mein Freund.\n
Lass mich nicht wieder\n
zur Peitsche greifen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}		{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Endlich bin ich hier...\n
Ob ich das wohl\n
alleine schaffe...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Du bist nicht allein.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
W-was?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Alle im Schloss haben\n
ihre Kr{RAW 0xE4}fte geb{RAW 0xFC}ndelt,\n
um dich zu erreichen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Also wissen alle...\n
dass ich Dracula bin?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja...\n
Arikado hat uns\n
alles erz{RAW 0xE4}hlt...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Bestimmt haben alle\n
Angst vor mir...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ach was!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Es war ein Schock,\n
aber wir alle glauben, \n
du wirst es schaffen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich schicke dir jetzt\n
ihre Botschaften.\n
H{RAW 0xF6}r zu...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Wann kommst du mal\n
wieder in meinen Laden?\n
Freu mich schon drauf!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Guten Morgen, Soma.\n
Ich habe gerade geh{RAW 0xF6}rt,\n
was geschehen ist...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Wie ich dir sagte...\n
Du bist du selbst - \n
lass ihn nicht gewinnen!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
An den Mann, der mich\n
besiegt hat... \n
Entt{RAW 0xE4}usche mich nicht!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Das ist die letzte Chance\n
f{RAW 0xFC}r dich - und f{RAW 0xFC}r uns.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich z{RAW 0xE4}hle auf dich...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Sie stehen alle...\n
an meiner Seite...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Du kannst es schaffen...\n
weil ich an dich glaube.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Na sch{RAW 0xF6}n, also los!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Sind wir wieder zur{RAW 0xFC}ck?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja, kein Zweifel. Wir \n
sind wieder zu Hause.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Ausgezeichnet...\n
Gut gemacht!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
He, was ist denn\n
mit den anderen?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Keine Sorge, sie\n
werden bald\n
hier sein.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Und das Schloss... \n
Ist das Schloss noch \n
in der Finsternis?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Ja. \n
Es erwartet die Ankunft\n
seines neuen Herrn.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Eines Tages wird jemand\n
wieder Draculas Gestalt\n
annehmen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Doch wann, das\n
wei{RAW 0xDF} ich nicht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Was ist, Soma? Wir\n
sind wieder zu Hause.\n
Wozu die Trauermiene?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Mir ist, als riefe das\n
Schloss noch immer\n
nach mir...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Vielleicht geh{RAW 0xF6}re ich ja\n
in Wahrheit dorthin?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ach, Einbildung! Wir\n
sind entkommen.\n
Du bist daheim...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja, hoffentlich bilde \n
ich mir das nur ein...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Du kannst dir Gedanken\n
machen, wenn dich das\n
Schloss wieder ruft.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Jetzt aber ruh dich aus.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja, du hast Recht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Es ist vorbei...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Der b{RAW 0xF6}se Geist \n
verblasst...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Hallo, Soma.\n
Ich gratuliere!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich muss jetzt los.\n
Eine neue Aufgabe\n
wartet auf mich.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Es war ein Schock, als\n
ich h{RAW 0xF6}rte, dass DU\n
Dracula bist...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich war gerade dabei\n
aufzuwachen, wei{RAW 0xDF}t du.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Aber eigentlich ist ja\n
alles nochmal gut\n
ausgegangen. Ha ha ha...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Deine St{RAW 0xE4}rke und deinen\n
Mut werde ich niemals\n
vergessen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Und ich habe dir noch gar\n
nicht f{RAW 0xFC}r meine Rettung\n
gedankt. Also... Danke!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Du bist wie ein kleiner\n
Bruder. War nett mit dir,\n
auf bald, hoffe ich!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Auf Wiedersehen!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hey! Freut mich, dass\n
du mein Gesch{RAW 0xE4}ft\n
beehrt hast.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Im Schloss wurde mir\n
klar, was ich will. \n
K{RAW 0xE4}mpfen jedenfalls nicht!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich werd wohl die Armee\n
verlassen und demn{RAW 0xE4}chst\n
einen Laden aufmachen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich hoffe, du kommst dann\n
mal vorbei. Mach' dir auch\n
nen guten Preis.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x05}{NAME 0x08}
Du hast gut gek{RAW 0xE4}mpft.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Als wir das Schloss ver-\n
lie{RAW 0xDF}en, ist die Macht des\n
Vampirkillers verblasst.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Keine Ahnung, was das\n
bedeutet. Im Moment\n
ist das ja auch egal.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Leb' wohl. Ich hoffe,\n
wir sehen uns wieder.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x02}{NAME 0x03}
Der von dir gew{RAW 0xE4}hlte\n
Weg war der h{RAW 0xE4}rteste. \n
Hast dich gut geschlagen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Damit Gott Gutes tun\n
kann, muss es auch\n
das B{RAW 0xF6}se geben.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Vermutlich folgt bald\n
wieder jemand Draculas\n
dunklen Spuren.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Vielleicht treffen wir\n
uns dann wieder.\n
Lebe wohl...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich danke dir im Namen\n
meiner Mutter.\n

Hnnnh... Ahh...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma! Gott sei Dank!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich hab mir solche\n
Sorgen um dich gemacht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Trotz Arikados Worten\n
f{RAW 0xFC}rchtete ich, du w{RAW 0xFC}rdest\n
nie mehr aufwachen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
H{RAW 0xF6}rte eure Stimmen.\n

Ihr habt mich wieder\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Eure lieben Worte und\n

mich zum Sieg...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ich bin so froh, dass du\n
trotz all dem du selbst\n
geblieben bist. \n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Bin ich doch gar nicht!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Nicht? Wieso nicht?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Jetzt bin ich viel cooler!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja... das ist neu.\n
Der alte Soma h{RAW 0xE4}tte\n
sowas nie gesagt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Vergiss nicht: in mir\n
schlummert die Macht\n

{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Sie mag nicht mehr b{RAW 0xF6}se\n

auf jeden Fall ver{RAW 0xE4}ndert.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Schon ok. Sollte wieder\n
etwas passieren, werden\n
alle dir helfen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja, ich glaube auch.\n
Schau, die Finsternis\n

He! Was hat denn ein Kind\n
wie du an so einem Ort\n

Ein Kind?! Ganz sch{RAW 0xF6}n\n

Oh, sorry. Mein Name ist\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hi. Ich bin Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Da untersuche ich einen\n
Schrein, und pl{RAW 0xF6}tzlich\n
bin ich in diesem Schloss.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Das kann man doch\n
nicht so einfach mit\n
einem machen, oder?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Also bin ich aus meiner\n
Mission ausgestiegen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Was meinst du damit?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Am Schrein hatten\n
sich einige komische\n
Leute versammelt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich dachte, das w{RAW 0xFC}rden\n
gute Kunden, also hab ich\n
einen Laden aufgemacht.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ahhh...\n
Gute Idee...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Im Schloss gibt's {RAW 0xFC}berall\n
Waffen, und am Eingang\n
sind keine Monster.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ideal f{RAW 0xFC}r einen Laden!\n
Schau mal rein! Bei mir\n

Kapier ich nicht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Tachchen. Da bist du ja.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Also hier hast du deinen\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
So isses. {RAW 0xDC}brigens, die\n

Eine Freundin von dir?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Wow! Ich hatte ja keinen\n
Schimmer, dass du bei\n
den M{RAW 0xE4}dels so ankommst.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
N-nein, so ist das nicht!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Na, nicht so sch{RAW 0xFC}chtern!\n
Ist doch 'ne feine Sache,\n
so jung zu sein!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Aber zur{RAW 0xFC}ck zum \n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hey, wieder da?\n
{RAW 0xDC}brigens, kennst du \n
Arikado?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Schon, irgendwie.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Komischer Kauz - auch ein\n
Freund von dir? Hast hier\n
anscheinend nur Freunde.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ist mir nicht sonderlich\n
sympathisch, sowas!\n
Also, was darf's sein?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
He, die Frau da dr{RAW 0xFC}ben...\n
ist bei der alles ok?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Keine Ahnung. Sie\n
wurde ziemlich schlimm\n
verwundet...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Meine Medizin wird nicht\n
viel helfen... Ich hoffe,\n
sie {RAW 0xFC}bersteht's...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja, ich auch.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Weil die n{RAW 0xE4}mlich\n
haargenau mein Typ ist...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Naja, muss mich ums\n
Gesch{RAW 0xE4}ft k{RAW 0xFC}mmern...\n

Du bist's... Wirkst\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
N-nein...\n
Nichts ist passiert...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Wirklich?\n
Na, wenn du's sagst...\n
Was darf's diesmal sein?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x06}{NAME 0x09}
Hallo, wieder da?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Mina!\n
Alles in Ordnung?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mir gehts gut. Sieht aus,\n
als k{RAW 0xE4}men die Ungeheuer\n
hier nicht mehr rein.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Arikado wollte eine\n
Schutzbarriere\n
errichten...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
{RAW 0xDC}brigens - wer ist\n
dieser Arikado\n
eigentlich?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ich bin nicht sicher. Ich\n
habe geh{RAW 0xF6}rt, er arbeitet\n
f{RAW 0xFC}r den Geheimdienst.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Geheimdienst? Das klingt\n
ja nach einem Spion.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Er kommt schon seit\n
Jahren zum Schrein. Ein\n
ungew{RAW 0xF6}hnlicher Mann.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wieso ungew{RAW 0xF6}hnlich?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Normalerweise ver{RAW 0xE4}ndert\n
sich doch ein Gesicht im\n
Lauf der Jahre, stimmt's?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Klar, wer {RAW 0xE4}lter wird,\n
ver{RAW 0xE4}ndert sich.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
In den letzten 10 Jahren\n
hat er sich aber kein\n
bisschen ver{RAW 0xE4}ndert.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Bildest du dir das\n
vielleicht nur ein?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Schon m{RAW 0xF6}glich, aber...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Sein Gesicht ist einfach\n
zu sch{RAW 0xF6}n. Fast schon\n
perfekt, meinst du nicht?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ach, dann ist er also\n
dein Typ, hmmmh?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
So ein Bl{RAW 0xF6}dsinn! Ich \n
mag Jungs, die...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
...\n
Das geht dich au{RAW 0xDF}erdem\n
gar nichts an, kapiert?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
War nicht so gemeint.\n
Wieso nimmst du immer\n
gleich alles so ernst?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
V-vergiss es... Meinst du\n
nicht, du solltest auch\n
besser hier bleiben?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Nein. Es hie{RAW 0xDF}, ich muss\n
noch was erledigen, um\n
uns hier rauszuholen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Au{RAW 0xDF}erdem habe ich\n
entdeckt, dass ich auch\n
magische Kr{RAW 0xE4}fte habe.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
(Ich sage lieber nicht,\n
wie gef{RAW 0xE4}hrlich l{RAW 0xE4}ngere\n
Aufenthalte hier sind...)\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ich verstehe... Aber\n
bitte sei vorsichtig.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Na klar.\n
Mina...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Vertraust du mir?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Nat{RAW 0xFC}rlich! \n
Ich wei{RAW 0xDF}, du w{RAW 0xFC}rdest\n
mich nie anl{RAW 0xFC}gen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Dann warte hier, bitte.\n
Ich bringe dich heim,\n
ich versprech's!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mach dir um mich\n
keine Sorgen. Ich warte,\n
solange es n{RAW 0xF6}tig ist.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Gut, bis bald also!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Pass auf dich auf, ok?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ok.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Da bist du ja wieder,\n
Soma. Hey...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Was?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Der Mann da dr{RAW 0xFC}ben...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wer? Ach, du meinst\n
Hammer?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Hammer hei{RAW 0xDF}t er? Der\n
k{RAW 0xF6}nnte einem fast Angst\n
machen, findest du nicht?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ach was, ich glaube, er\n
ist ganz in Ordnung.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Aber sieh dir doch nur\n
die ganzen Waffen an,\n
die er da hat...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Er sagt, er will einen\n
Laden aufmachen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Hier!? Einen Laden\n
hier im Schloss? \n
Komischer Typ...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja, ganz sch{RAW 0xF6}n\n
schr{RAW 0xE4}g...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Aber wenn du meinst,\n
er ist in Ordnung, will\n
ich's dir mal glauben.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Oh! Soma.\n
Ob Yoko wohl wieder\n
in Ordnung kommt...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Kennst du Yoko?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja... Ich kenne sie\n
schon von klein auf\n
von uns zu Hause.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich bin ein Einzelkind,\n
sie ist f{RAW 0xFC}r mich sowas\n
wie eine gro{RAW 0xDF}e Schwester.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ich verstehe... Hat\n
Arikado sie hergebracht?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Dann ist sie bestimmt\n
ok. Er sagt, wir sollen\n
uns nicht um sie sorgen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Er war zuversichtlich,\n
dass er sie retten kann.\n
Darum brachte er sie her.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Also gut, wenn du sagst,\n
sie kommt in Ordnung...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ich wei{RAW 0xDF}, es ist hart f{RAW 0xFC}r\n
dich, aber halte durch...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ok.\n
{RAW 0xDC}berlass es ruhig mir.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Da bist du ja wieder.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wie geht es Yoko?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Noch bewusstlos.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Sieht aus, als h{RAW 0xE4}tte sie\n
gro{RAW 0xDF}e Schmerzen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Manchmal schreit sie\n
vor Schmerzen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ich verstehe...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Willkommen zur{RAW 0xFC}ck.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
H{RAW 0xE4}ltst du noch durch?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mir geht es gut.\n
Danke der Nachfrage.\n
	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ich bin etwas m{RAW 0xFC}de...\n
Aber mach dir keine\n
Sorgen deswegen.\n
	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mir geht's gut. Du sorgst\n
dich um mich, als w{RAW 0xE4}re\n
ich etwas Kostbares.\n
	{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
In letzter Zeit hatte ich\n
heftige Kopfschmerzen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mein K{RAW 0xF6}rper f{RAW 0xFC}hlt sich\n
manchmal ganz schwer an.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Manchmal f{RAW 0xFC}hle ich mich\n
hier so unbehaglich.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Kommst du klar?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja.\n
Mach dir keine Sorgen.\n
Mir geht's gut.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mir ist in letzter Zeit\n
so seltsam... Ich bin\n
v{RAW 0xF6}llig ersch{RAW 0xF6}pft...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mir wird manchmal so\n
schwindelig, ich verliere\n
das Bewusstsein...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Manchmal kann ich Arme\n
und Beine nicht bewegen.\n
Was ist los mit mir?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Kommst du wirklich klar?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Mach dir keine Sorgen.\n
Ich komme gut zurecht.\n
Warten macht mir nichts.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Wenn du es sagst...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
(Ich muss einen Fluchtweg\n
finden - und zwar fix!)\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Da... bist du ja wieder...\n
Du bist doch Soma...?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Ja...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Was ist geschehen? Du\n
siehst so...gruselig aus.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
N-nichts ist passiert.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
(Ich will nicht, dass sie\n
die Wahrheit erf{RAW 0xE4}hrt!)\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Na sch{RAW 0xF6}n...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Hey, Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Was?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
Wenn ich nicht mehr Soma\n
w{RAW 0xE4}re, wie f{RAW 0xE4}ndest du das?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
W... was hast du denn?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
H{RAW 0xF6}r doch mal. Wenn ich...\n
Wenn ich wie ich auss{RAW 0xE4}he,\n
aber...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Wenn ich innen drin\n
jemand anders w{RAW 0xE4}re...\n
wie w{RAW 0xE4}re das f{RAW 0xFC}r dich?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Was rede ich denn blo{RAW 0xDF}?\n
Vergiss, was ich gerade\n
gesagt habe, Mina, ok?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Vielleicht w{RAW 0xFC}rde ich dich\n
nicht mehr m{RAW 0xF6}gen. Deine\n
Augen wirken unheimlich..\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Mir w{RAW 0xE4}re ein ge{RAW 0xE4}ndertes\n
Aussehen und ein gleich\n
gebliebenes Wesen lieber.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
Vergib mir, wenn ich\n
mich jemals {RAW 0xE4}ndere...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
...\n
Was meinst du mit\n
"dir vergeben"?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
N-nichts...\n
Ich muss gehen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Nein!\n
Soma, WARTE!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Was ist los, Soma?\n
Du bist in letzter Zeit\n
so komisch.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
G-gar nicht wahr.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Sieht dir nicht {RAW 0xE4}hnlich,\n
was vor mir zu verbergen!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
Tut mir Leid... Aber\n
das kann ich dir einfach\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
nicht sagen. \n
Ich muss gehen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Da bist du ja wieder.\n
Ich habe eine Botschaft\n
von Arikado f{RAW 0xFC}r dich.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Von Arikado?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja, sie lautet, {RAW 0xE4}h...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}	Verringert sich das Tempo\n
deines Falls, kannst du\n
weiter springen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Versuch dir vorzustellen,\n
du w{RAW 0xFC}rdest durch die\n
Luft gleiten...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Wenn du TP und MP\n
tauschen kannst, hast\n
du einen Gegner, den du\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
auf der Stelle besiegen\n
kannst.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Verstehe ich eigentlich\n
nicht, aber... dir hilft\n
es, oder?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Wenn du bei vollem Tempo\n
auf dem Wasser l{RAW 0xE4}ufst,\n
k{RAW 0xF6}nntest du die Wasser-\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
wand mit deinem starken\n
K{RAW 0xF6}rper durchbrechen.\n
Was soll das hei{RAW 0xDF}en?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Vielleicht, dass das f{RAW 0xFC}r\n
Menschen unm{RAW 0xF6}glich ist?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Es gibt einen Feind, der\n
sich so schnell bewegt,\n
dass er unsichtbar ist.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
K{RAW 0xF6}nntest du die Zeit\n
anhalten, dann k{RAW 0xF6}nntest\n
du ihn vielleicht sehen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Irgendwo im Schloss ist\n
ein Ungeheuer, das die\n
Zeit anhalten kann.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Und manche Ungeheuer sind\n
angeblich immun gegen das\n
Einfrieren in der Zeit.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Stehst du auf dem Wasser\n
und springst von dort,\n
gelangst du dort hinauf.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Auf dem Wasser stehen?!\n
Vielleicht musst du wie\n
ein Ninja handeln?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Es gibt einen Bereich,\n
der nur durchs Wasser\n
zu erreichen ist.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Das k{RAW 0xF6}nnte f{RAW 0xFC}r Menschen\n
ohne Tauchausr{RAW 0xFC}stung aber\n
zu schwer sein.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Schaust du hoch und\n
siehst einen D{RAW 0xE4}mon am\n
Altar, so ist dort auch\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
noch etwas anderes.\n
D{RAW 0xE4}mon am Altar, was,\n
kann das wohl sein?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Irgendwo im Schloss\n
muss es alte B{RAW 0xFC}cher\n
geben, die von Draculas\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Macht sprechen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Ich frage mich, was f{RAW 0xFC}r\n
B{RAW 0xFC}cher das wohl sind.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	Einige Bereiche der Burg\n
sind angeblich verhext.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Und andere f{RAW 0xFC}hren zu\n
anderen Orten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Du gelangst also nicht\n
immer dorthin zur{RAW 0xFC}ck, von\n
wo du gekommen bist.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ich verstehe...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Komm sp{RAW 0xE4}ter wieder.\n
Vielleicht habe ich dann\n
etwas mehr von Arikado.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ich frage wieder nach,\n
so oft ich kann.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hmm... Das ergibt\n
{RAW 0xFC}berhaupt keinen Sinn.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Was ist los, Soma?\n
Du bist in letzter Zeit\n
so komisch.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
G-gar nicht wahr.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Sieht dir nicht {RAW 0xE4}hnlich,\n
was vor mir zu verbergen!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x07}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
Tut mir Leid... Aber\n
das kann ich dir einfach\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
nicht sagen. \n
Ich muss gehen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Soma!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Da bist du ja wieder.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Hey, Mina...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Was ist los?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Sag mal, worum geht\n
es bei dem Hakuba-\n
Schrein eigentlich?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Naja - kennst du die\n
Geschichte des \n
Amanoiwado-Schreins?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Davon habe ich schon\n
geh{RAW 0xF6}rt, glaube ich.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Es hei{RAW 0xDF}t, darin verbarg\n
sich Tensho Daijin, um\n
Sosanoo zu beruhigen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ach ja, ich wei{RAW 0xDF} wieder.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Tensho Daijin ist die\n
Sonne. Das Verstecken\n
ist die Sonnenfinsternis.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Indem sie sich verbarg,\n
konnte sie Susanoos Zorn\n
beschwichtigen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Darum vermutet man in \n
Sonnenfinsternissen Zorn\n
und b{RAW 0xF6}se Absichten.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja, die Menschen beten\n
seit Jahrhunderten zu\n
Eklipsen.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Und genau dazu\n
dient auch der \n
Hakuba-Schrein.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Jetzt verstehe ich...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Und normalerweise gibt\n
es nur Feiern bei Japans\n
Sonnenfinsternissen, aber.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
1999 fand auch in Europa\n
eine Feier statt...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Ja... Davon habe ich\n
geh{RAW 0xF6}rt.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Und dabei wurde dann\n
auch Draculas Schloss\n
darin versiegelt...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Darum wusste ich, dass\n
das, was Arikado\n
gesagt hatte...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ja, ich wei{RAW 0xDF} jetzt, dass\n
er die Wahrheit sagte.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x01}{NAME 0x02}
Tut mir Leid.\n
Ich war dir keine gro{RAW 0xDF}e\n
Hilfe.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Doch, mir ist jetzt etwas\n
leichter. \n
Danke, Mina.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Sie sieht aus, als\n
schliefe sie...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Ob sie ihr\n
Bewusstsein wohl\n
je wiedererlangt?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}	{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Yoko, bitte stirb nicht...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}		{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
Dracula ist--!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x04}{NAME 0x05}
...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x00}{NAME 0x01}
Puh... Sie halluziniert\n
nur... Ich dachte schon,\n
sie w{RAW 0xFC}sste Bescheid...\n
