DSVRandom (DSVania Randomizer) is a randomizer for the three Castlevania games for the Nintendo DS: Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia.

### Features

DSVRandom has options to randomize the following:

* Items (Randomizes items you find lying on the ground.)
* Souls/Relics/Glyphs (Randomizes souls in candles, relics, subweapons, spells, dual crushes, glyphs in statues, and free glyphs.)
* Enemies (Replaces non-boss enemies with other non-boss enemies.)
* Bosses
* Enemy Drops (Items, souls, and glyphs. Also randomizes the drop chance.)
* Boss Souls
* Area Connections (Randomizes which areas are connected to each other.)
* Room Connections (Randomizes which rooms are connected to each other.)
* Starting Room
* Enemy AI (Makes enemies behave like other enemies. Very buggy. Can cause crashes.)
