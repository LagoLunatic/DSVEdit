    3 (080E1326) - Weapon
    4 (080E1328) - Slide (and Julius's uppercut)

  3 (ability) - 9

080E2B04-080E2B23 - List of how VRAM indexes map to tile offsets in VRAM.
  Each entry is a halfword.
  The index is a VRAM index in terms of 128x32px chunks.
  Each value is an offset in VRAM in terms of 8x8px tiles. So multiply this by 0x20 to get the offset in bytes.
  The way these indexes would map out visually to VRAM is like this:
    [    0    ] [    4    ]
    [    1    ] [    5    ]
    [    2    ] [    6    ]
    [    3    ] [    7    ]
    [    8    ] [    C    ]
    [    9    ] [    D    ]
    [    A    ] [    E    ]
    [    B    ] [    F    ]
  So e.g. F means the player's spot in VRAM, 0 means the common sprite's spot, E means the player's weapon's spot, etc.
