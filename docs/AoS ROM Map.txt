Starting stats (hardcoded):
08033DC2,1 - Starting STR

08033DCA,1 - Starting INT
08033DCE,1 - Starting LCK

080E0DF8 - List of songs->text indexes for sound test mode.
  Entry length 4.
  00,2: Song index.
  02,2: Text index.

080E1320 - List of damage multipliers for the player's jumpkick/weapon/slide attacks.
  Each entry is a halfword.
  Indexes:
    2 (080E1324) - Jumpkick
    3 (080E1326) - Weapon
    4 (080E1328) - Slide (and Julius's uppercut)
  The other types of attack don't use this list so those entries are just 0.
  A 0x10 multiplier is equivalent to 1.0. For example, jumpkick has a multiplier of 8, meaning jumpkick damage is equivalent to STR*0.5.

080E13BC-080E1553 - List of skill gfx.
  Entry length 0xC.
  00,4: GFX pointer
  04,4: Palette pointer

080E15A8 - List of red souls.

080E2B04-080E2B23 - List of how VRAM indexes map to tile offsets in VRAM.
  Each entry is a halfword.
  The index is a VRAM index in terms of 128x32px chunks.
  Each value is an offset in VRAM in terms of 8x8px tiles. So multiply this by 0x20 to get the offset in bytes.
  The way these indexes would map out visually to VRAM is like this:
    [    0    ] [    4    ]
    [    1    ] [    5    ]
    [    2    ] [    6    ]
    [    3    ] [    7    ]
    [    8    ] [    C    ]
    [    9    ] [    D    ]
    [    A    ] [    E    ]
    [    B    ] [    F    ]
  So e.g. F means the player's spot in VRAM, 0 means the common sprite's spot, E means the player's weapon's spot, etc.

080E11C4 - Soma's sprite pointer.

  Entry length 4.
  00,2: Width.
  02,2: Height.
  These aren't perfect representations of every entity's size, just generic sizes like 8x8, 16x16, 48x48, etc, used to estimate the size.

084F1238 - List of pointers to weapon swing animation indexes.
  Index is the player's state, 0 for standing, 1 for crouching, 2 for in the air. (Maybe more?)
  Each pointer points to a list of player animation indexes. Each group of 3 bytes is for a weapon attack type. Each byte within the group is for a weapon swing animation.

084F128C - differentiates evil butcher/ripper knives
  Entry length 0x10.
  00,4: GFX pointer
  04,4: Palette pointer
  08,4: Sprite pointer
  0C,

084F12C8 - Has data to differentiate projectile red souls that share the same code pointer 08025785/08028EC1.
  The red soul data's var A is the index in this list.
  Entry length 0x18.

    0 means no SFX.
  12,2: Bitfield affecting the behavior of the projectile.
    ?
    0001 - Whether this projectile's sprite should be animated as opposed to a static frame.
      If set, the projectile's animation is set to the animation index at 0E.
      If not, the projectile's frame is set to the frame index at 0D.
    0002 - Breaks on contact with the floor?
    0008 - If set, this entity's pointer gets stored to 02013160.
    0080 - runs code at 0802583C

  09,1: 

08526390-085263A7 - List of boss rush rewards.
  00,2: Maximum number of frames you can take to complete boss rush and still get this reward.
  04,4: Item global ID+1 of the reward.

08526650 - List of pointers to event create functions (for object 20).
  The event object's var A is the index in this list.
085266D8 - List of pointers to event update functions (for object 20).
  The event object's var A is the index in this list.

Shop item pools:
08526C6C-08526C77 - List of shop item pools:
  08526C04
  08526C1C
  08526C40
  In each of those item pools, the first byte is the number of items in this pool.
  Then each item also takes up one byte. But these aren't item IDs - they're indexes in list 085269FC.
085269FC - List of allowable items that can be in the shop.
  Each entry is 4 bytes long.
  00,1: Item type.
  01,1: Item index.
