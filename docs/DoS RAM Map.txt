  Valid pickup flags range from 00 to BF.
  020F7190-020F719F (flags 00-7F) are definitely reserved for pickup flags.
  020F71A0-020F71A7 (flags 80-BF) are most likely for pickup flags as nothing else seems to read or write these bytes. However, the vanilla game didn't have any flags that went into these bytes, so it's not 100% verifiable if they're really for flags or not.

0222F1DC-0222F1EF - List of pointers to magic seal data.
  e.g. 0222F270
  Format of each magic seal data:
  00,2: Number of points on the circumference circle.
  02,2: Radius of the circle in pixels.
    Signed. Negative values invert the circle vertically.
  04,2: Visual rotation of the points along the circle.
    Every 0x4000 is equivalent to 90 degrees.
  06,2: Number of midpoints along each line the player needs to touch for the line to count as successfully drawn.
    For example, if this is 20, the player needs to hit at least 20 midpoints along the line, so each line will take at least 20 frames to draw. If this is 1, the player can just jump straight from one point to the next, so each line only requires 1 frame to draw. The higher the number of midpoints the smoother and slower the player must draw the line for it to count.
    This is 4 for all five seals in the vanilla game.
  08,4: Speed the seal autocompletes itself at after the player manually completes it.
