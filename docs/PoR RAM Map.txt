02111794-0211196D Explored map tile list.
  Each tile takes up 2 bits.
  The first bit is set if it's revealed by a map item but not explored.
  Both bits are set if it's explored.
  Each area's list starts at:
  00 02111794 Dracula's Castle
  01 021118AC City of Haze

  The game doesn't have a list of pointers to each of these lists for each area. Instead function 02030570 is used to hardcode these pointers.
  Note that these bits are grouped into halfword bitfields. So the next area's list doesn't start until the next multiple of 2 bytes after the previous list ended.

  102,2: Y pos in pixels. (Not used?)
  118,4: X pos in subpixels. (Not used?)

  121,1: Green color multiplier out of 0x1F.
  122,1: Blue color multiplier out of 0x1F.

0211A698-0211A717 - List of how many consecutive slots are used in list 02112698 for each entity.
  Each entry is a byte. The byte is the number of slots in a row that are used by this group of entity slots.
  For example, if an entity requests 5 slots of entity memory, the first 5 bytes in this list will all be 5.
  (Note that the function responsible for reading this and finding the next free slot (0201DA80) seems to have a bug where it will skip one more slot than is necessary per group of entity slots, which can result in inefficient packing of slots together.)

0211A718,4 - Total slots in list 02112698 that are currently in use.
  (The game engine might be bugged and sometimes resets this to 0 even when slots are in use...?)

0211A756,1 - What area name index to show on the top screen.

0213282C - List of something related to hitboxes?
  Entry length 1.
  The index in this list for a particular entity is at offset+0xA7 in the entity memory.
  These seem to be how many hitboxes the entity has active. 0 1 or 2.
0213291C - List of hitboxes. Each entry is 0x14 bytes long, containing two hitboxes 0xA bytes long each.
  The index in this list for a particular entity is at offset+0xA7 in the entity memory.

  List of pointers to entries in asset memory.

    6 Subweapon
    8 Dual crush sprite
    9 Spell
    A Richter
    B Maria / Charlotte?
    C Jonathan?
    D 
  The space between each entry here seems to be hardcoded around 02011FC0. 0x8700 is the difference between Richter and Maria's sprite file space for example.
  (The last one is found first via the normal means. Then the others are spaced out before it by subtracting hardcoded values from that.)
