Memory used for entities in AoS is 020004E4 - 02007863. Each entity is 0x84 bytes long. They range from 0-DF.

00,4: Pointer to update code.
04,4: Pointer to draw code.
0A,1: State.
0B,1: Substate.
10,1: Entity slot index.
  The index this entity is at in list 020004E4.
14,1: ?

  For enemies composed of multiple entities, this may be a pointer to the parent entity.
22,2: Frame counter.
24,4: 
2C,4: X acceleration?
2D,1: Counter for how many frames to keep flashing white after being damaged.
  This is set when the enemy is damaged and decremented every frame.
  If bit 02 is set the enemy will be drawn pure white or normal otherwise. (In other words, the enemy will be white for 2 frames, then normal for 2 frames, and then repeat until the counter is 0.)
  Certain enemies freeze as long as this is above 0.

  In the GBA games, each pixel is 0x10000 subpixels.
  Note that unlike the DSVanias, there is no X/Y pos in the room. Only on the screen.
42,2: X pos on the screen in pixels.
  Sometimes only the upper halfword of the X/Y pos is read.
46,2: Y pos on the screen in pixels.
  Sometimes only the upper halfword of the X/Y pos is read.
48,4: X velocity.
4C,4: Y velocity.
50,4: X acceleration.
54,4: Y acceleration (gravity).
58,1: Bitfield related to sprite drawing.
  20 Do not draw this entity.
  40 Horizontal flip.
  80 Vertical flip.
59,1: Bitfield?
  04 ?
5A,1: Another bitfield related to sprite drawing.
