DoS Enemy DNA:
  0x24 bytes long.
  00,4: Pointer to enemy create code.
  04,4: Pointer to enemy update code.
  08,2: Item1. Global ID+1 of the item.
  0A,2: Item2. Global ID+1 of the item.
  0C,1: Palette offset to use when this enemy is petrified.
  0D,1: Unknown.
    Ranges from 1 (for Zombie) to 99 decimal (for Dracula). As you scroll down the list of enemies this value only gets bigger or stays the same, never smaller.
  0E,2: Max HP.
  10,2: Max MP.
  12,2: EXP.
  14,1: Chance to drop its soul.
    00 is a guaranteed drop, but after that it scales from 01 (rare) to FF (very common, but not guaranteed).
    The formula for calculating soul drop chance is as follows:
      this_number / (512 - luck/8)
    So, if the player has 0 luck, and an enemy has 8 for this number, the chance to get its soul is:
      8 / (512 - 0/8) = 1.56%
    If the player has 99 luck instead, and the enemy still has 8 for this number, the chance to get its soul is:
      8 / (512 - 99/8) = 1.60%
    Yes, luck has almost no effect on soul drop chances.
    The Soul Eater Ring basically doubles the drop chance, the formula is:
      (this_number*2 + 0.125) / (512 - luck/8)
    On hard mode, luck has 4x the effect on soul/item chances.
    Visually in the bestiary, 00 here shows as no rarity stars, 01-08 shows as 3 rarity stars, 09-1E shows as 2 rarity stars, and 1F-FF shows as 1 rarity star.
    Luck has no impact on rarity stars.
  15,1: Attack stat.
  16,1: Defense stat.
    Doubles as both physical and magical defense.
  17,1: Chance to drop an item.
    The formula for calculating item drop chance is as follows:
      (this_number*3) / (1024 - luck)
    So, if the player has 0 luck, and an enemy has 8 for this number, the chance to get its item 1 is:
      (8*3) / (1024 - 0) = 2.34%
    If the player has 99 luck instead, and the enemy still has 8 for this number, the chance to get its item 1 is:
      (8*3) / (1024 - 99) = 2.59%
    So luck has more effect on item drops than soul drops, but the effect is still very small.
    The Rare Ring doubles the drop chance, the formula is:
      (this_number*3*2) / (1024 - luck)
    Once it's been decided that you're going to get an item drop, it then decides whether you'll get Item1 or Item2.
    If the enemy has only an Item1, Item1 will drop.
    If the enemy has an Item2, the chance of the drop being the rarer Item2 is:
      256 / (1024 - luck)
    The Rare Ring also doubles that chance.
    If that Item2 chance fails, Item1 will drop. Or nothing will drop if the enemy has no Item1.
    On hard mode, luck has 4x the effect on soul/item chances.
  18,2: ???
  1A,1: Local ID of the soul this enemy drops. FF means no soul.
  1B,1: This is the number of points/slots this enemy's soul costs to place in enemy set mode.
    00 means it can't be placed in enemy set mode.
  1C,4: Which elements this enemy is weak to. Bitfield.
    In DoS, weaknesses increase damage the enemy takes if the enemy is weak to any of the elements of the attack.
    If at least one of those elements is magical (Fire/Ice/Lightning/Dark/Holy), the multiplier is 1.5x damage.
    Otherwise, if it's just physical or status effect weaknesses (Strike/Stab/Slash/Poison/Curse/Stone), the multiplier is 1.25x.
    Bits 1-11: Regular elemental types.
    Bit 16: The enemy is made of flesh, it makes a fleshy sound effect and graphical effect when you attack it.
  20,4: Which elements this enemy is resistant to. Bitfield.
    In DoS, resistances halve damage the enemy takes only if the enemy resists ALL elements of the attack. (Only counting the base 8 elements, Poison/Curse/Stone don't necessarily have to be resisted too.)
    Unlike PoR/OoE, resisting Poison/Curse/Stone in DoS does actually decrease damage.
    Bit 13: Immune to time stop.
    Bit 14: Unknown. All bosses and Final Guard have this set.
    Bit 15: Immune to backstabs.
    Bit 16: Unknown. Only used by Tombstone.
