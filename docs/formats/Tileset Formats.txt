Tileset:
Each block in the tileset is 4 bytes long.
Starts from the first real tile, not the blank tile.
Bits   1-6: Index of the tile on the tile page.
Bits  7-12: Seems unused.
Bits 13-17: Tile page index.
Bit     18: Horizontal flip.
Bit     19: Vertical flip.
Bits 20-24: Seems unused.
Bits 25-32: Palette index.

Collision tileset:
Each block in the tileset is 4 bytes long.
Starts from the first real tile, not the blank tile.
Byte 1: The collision of this tile. See Tile collision values.
Byte 2: 00
Byte 3: 0B
Byte 4: 3C

Tile collision values:
Bitfield. Least significant bit first.
Bit 1: Platform you can jump up through. Combine with bit 2 to get a fully solid block.
Bit 2: Varies depending on the value of bits 5-8:
  0-3 - Solid bottom, left, and right, but top pushes you downwards and out to either the left or right.
  4-F - Floor slope when 0, ceiling slope when 1. (Vertical flip.)
Bit 3: Varies depending on the value of bits 5-8:
  0-1 - Damage. Gets overridden by water.
  2   - Conveyor belt left.
  3   - Conveyor belt right.
  4-F - When 0, slopes from top left to bottom right. When 1, slopes from bottom left to top right. (Horizontal flip.)
Bit 4: Water. Overrides damage.
Bit 5-8: Shape of the block:
  0000 - Full block.
  0001 - ??? Same as 0?
  0010 - Half-height block (top half).
  0011 - Half-height block (bottom half).
  0100 - Normal slope.
  0101 - ???
  0110 - ???
  0111 - ???
  1000 - 2-part slope, highest part.
  1001 - ???
  1010 - 2-part slope, lowest part.
  1011 - ???
  1100 - 4-part slope, highest part.
  1101 - 4-part slope, higher-middle part.
  1110 - 4-part slope, lower-middle part.
  1111 - 4-part slope, lowest part.
