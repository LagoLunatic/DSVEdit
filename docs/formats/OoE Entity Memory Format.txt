Memory used for entities in OoE is 021092A0 - 0211DF5F. Each entity is 0x160 bytes long. They range from 0-F1.

000,4: Pointer to update code.
004,4: Pointer to draw code.
008,4: Pointer to destroy code?
00D,1: State of the entity. Each entity's update code handles this differently.
010,2:
012,2: Globally unique ID for this entity.
01A,2: Frame counter.
021,1: Opacity.
024,4: X pos on the screen.
028,4: Y pos on the screen.
02C,4: Z position.
030,4: X pos.
034,4: Y pos.
038,4: Z pos.
03C,4: X velocity.
040,4: Y velocity.
044,4: Movement speed.
  This is the absolute speed value this entity should move at, without taking direction into account.
  Currently only Skull Spider is known to use this.
048,4: X friction.
04C,4: Y acceleration (gravity).
064,2: Rotation.
  Every 0x4000 is equivalent to 90 degrees.
06C,2: Sprite info index.
  This is an index in the currently loaded sprite info list, 0211E0C0.
074,4: Bitfield related to sprite drawing.
  0004 Enable rotation.
  0020 Ignore part palette indexes. Always used palette 0 for every part.
    Note that things that affect the entire entity's palette are not affected by this, like the entity's palette offset. Only the palette specified by each sprite part is ignored.
    (This is used by the slash trails of melee weapons.)
  0040 Ignore part GFX page indexes?
  0080 Direction. Set if facing left, clear if facing right.
  0200 Pulsating effect, used by Invisible Man.
  0400 If set, the entity's opacity value will only be used when drawing parts that have a nonzero palette index.
    (This is used by the slash trails of melee weapons.)
  8000 Invisible, do not draw.
078,4: Pointer to sprite animation list.
07C,2: Current animation index.
07E,2: Current keyframe index in this animation.
080,2: Bitfield of sprite animation properties.
  01 - Animation finished. This is set automatically by SpriteAnimate when an animation finishes its first loop.
  02 - Do not loop animation
  04 - Play animation in reverse
  08 - Do not animate, just freeze on whatever the current keyframe is
082,2: Delay in frames remaining before advancing to the next animation keyframe.
084,2: Current sprite frame index.
086,2: Palette index in the list of globally loaded palettes.
088,2: Palette index in the list of globally loaded palettes. Unused?
08A,2: Palette offset for this entity. Gets added to the value at 086,2.
08E,2: Polygon attributes to use when drawing this entity.
  Refer to GBATEK for details.
090,10: Affects color tint of this entity. 1F for everything means normal colored.
0A0,2: Sprite x offset relative to the entity's position.
0A2,2: Sprite y offset relative to the entity's position.
0A4,1: Controls the iframes this entity should give.
  This is an index in list 020B5C28 - a list of different iframes values. Each entry is 1 byte long.
  This value is only read when the entity is initialized, changing it after the entity already exists has no effect.
0A6,1: Hitbox bitfield.
  Bits:
  0x1: Whether this entity's hitboxes are active or not.
0A7,1: Index of this entity's hitbox in the global hitbox list (02128BDC).
0A8,2: Damage.
0AA,2: Physical defense.
0AC,4: Bitfield of damage types.
0B0,4: Bitfield of resistances.
0B4,4: Bitfield of weaknesses.
0B8,2: Number of iframes this entity gives.
0C0,2: Magical defense.
0C8,4: On-hurt-player callback.
  This function pointer is called when the entity collides with the player.
0CC,4: On-damaged callback.
  This function pointer is called when the entity collides with a player weapon.
132,1: Subtype.
133,1: Type.
13C,2: Var A.
13E,2: Var B.

For enemies:
124,2: Bitfield of ???
  0001 - Does not deal or take damage.
  0080 - Initial
  1000 - If set, the palette offset at 131,1 will be used as this enemy's palette offset when it is dying.
  20C2 - hit?
  20C6 - petrified?
126,1: For enemies, has the petrified palette index from the enemy DNA.
12A,2: The magical defense value from the enemy DNA.
12E,2: Palette to use when dying?? (index in the list of globally loaded palettes).
130,1: Palette offset?
131,1: Palette offset?
138,2: The attack value from the enemy DNA.
13A,2: The physical defense value from the enemy DNA.

For skeletally animated enemies:
158,4: Pointer to the skeletal animation entry for this enemy, in list 02101200.

For items:
0E0,4: The global ID+1 of the item.

For money:
0E0,4: The type of money (0-6 for different values of money).

For blue chests:
0D8,4: Pointer to function (02061E28) that checks if the corresponding boss is dead to make the chest pop out of the ground.
  For blue chests that are not for a no damage boss medal, this is 0 instead of a function pointer.

For glyph pickups:
0D6,2: ?
0D8,4: ?
0DC,4: The pickup flag to set.
12C,1: Type of the glyph.
  1 - Arm glyph.
  2 - Back glyph.

For used glyphs:
120,4: Bitfield.
  00000001 - Horizontally flipped.
  00000002 - Skill was used by an enemy (e.g. Fomors) as opposed to the player.
    This overrides this skill's on-hurt-enemy callback function with a different one so that it hurts the player instead.
    It also changes the damage calculation formula, so that it uses the enemy's attack value in place of the player's STR/INT, and so the enemy's attack value is weighted more than the skill's damage multiplier.
124,4: Pointer to the entity that used this skill (e.g. player).
12C,1: Slot this glyph is in.
  0 - Y-button arm glyph
  1 - X-button arm glyph
  2 - Back glyph
  3 - Glyph union
12D,1: Index of the glyph in that type's list.

For used skills:
124,4: Pointer to the entity who used this skill (e.g. 02109820 if the player used it).
128,2: Globally unique ID of the entity who used this skill.

For summons:
12E,2: The summon's level. 1-3.
  This acts as a multiplier to certain things like damage dealt and movement speed.
140,4: Which summon index (e.g. 1 for Fidelis Aranea)

For the player:
0D0,4: Bitfield of player state booleans.
  For glyphs, ?
0DC,4: Bitfield of ?
  00080000 - Do not interrupt the player's current animation when landing.
0ED,1: Which player character index this player is. 0 is Shanoa, 1 is Arma Felix, etc.
