    Bits 1-11: Regular elemental types.
    Bit 26: Is a subweapon.
      All subweapons set this bit automatically, even if it's not set in the item editor.
      An enemy only grants SP when killed if it was hit at least once by a skill with this bit set.
      So if you want to make a spell be usable by Jonathan and gain SP, set this bit too.
    Bit 27: Is a spell.
      All spells set this bit automatically, even if it's not set in the item editor.
      If either this bit, or any of the bits for fire/ice/lightning/dark/holy are set, enemies will use their magical defense to defend against this weapon, instead of their physical defense.
    Bit 28: Cures vampirism and kills red skeletons/axe armors.
      This only cures the sisters if the Spell bit is also set.
      Cures Vincent and kills red skeletons/axe armors whether the Spell bit is set or not.

    Bit 5: No trailing slash effect on the weapon.
    Bit 6: ??? Used for Heaven's Sword.
    Bit 7: ? Used for all whips. The only one it seems to affect is the unlocked Vampire killer, turning it off for that disables the palette cycling it does.
    Bit 8: Gives weapon a shaky echo effect.
    Bit 9: If combined with bit 4, the weapon stops swinging immediately. Basically this is the inverse of how it worked in DoS.
    Bit 10:
    Bit 11:
    Bit 12: Weapon persists even when the player's swing animation ends.
    Bit 13: Whip cannot be dangled.

      If either this bit, or any of the bits for fire/ice/lightning/dark/holy are set, enemies will use their magic defense to defend against this skill, instead of their physical defense.
      You don't need to set this manually. The game automatically sets this bit for spells. But you can manually set this for subweapons, and enemies will use their magic defense instead of their physical defense against that subweapon.
    Bit 28: Cures vampirism and kills red skeletons/axe armors.
      This only cures the sisters if the magical bit is also set.
      Cures Vincent and kills red skeletons/axe armors whether the magical bit is set or not.
